## Detailed description about the program.
This debate camp is all about learning to speak and come up with arguments in front of others on the spot. Our two teachers will be working with kids to improve their public speaking and debating skills. In this program, we will be showing them how to come up with solid arguments and back up claims with well-thought evidence, as well as teach them the fundamentals of good body language and persuasion. After leaving our course, all the kids will be well prepared to speak in front of audiences and their classes because of their newly earned confidence. We hope that the kids learn a lot of new skills, but also have a lot of fun at the same time because we will always have activities and games planned for their learning.
